Rotherator is a program to help decide the best strategy for how (or whether) to move traditional IRA funds into a Roth IRA. The goal of this program is to analyze cash flow using various assumptions about the economy based on historical data, each with several different assumptions about the Roth transfer scenarios. Several dozen of these scenarios are computed and then the results can be viewed graphically from several different perspectives to see how the Roth transfer scenarios compare under different assumptions about the economy. Complete documentation is in a PDF file in the release package.
