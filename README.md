Rotherator is a program to help decide the best strategy for how (or whether)
to move traditional IRA funds into a Roth IRA. If you have a sizeable nest
egg in an IRA, the required minimum distributions eventually put you into a
higher tax bracket than you might have thought, so it might be better to move
IRA funds into a Roth account where the gains will not be taxed and there are
no required minimum distributions. Should you move it as a lump sum, or
spread the transfers out over several years? If you transfer funds from a
traditional IRA into a Roth, you pay more tax when the transfer occurs, but
from that point forward it accumulates with no additional tax due. 
This program analyzes the cash flow using various
assumptions about the economy - interest, dividend, stock growth, and 
inflation rates - and various assumptions about the Roth transfer scenarios. 
Several dozen of these scenarios are computed and then
the results can be viewed and compared graphically from several different
perspectives. The full documentation is in the [PDF file](Rotherator.pdf)
in the release package.
